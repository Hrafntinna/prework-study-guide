## Description


I was motivated to learn about web development and though following the instructions given I leaned how to:
- Use basic HTML to make the skeleton of a webpage
- Use basic CSS to make said webpage look nice
- Use javascript to add logic to the webpage
- Use Github to learn about version control and add to my webpage in manageable increments

It solves the problem of my wanting to make a webpage but not knowing how, and through its creation I learned the means to make a basic webpage and the basic ins and outs of how a webpage works.


## Installation

At the time of writing I access my webpage through the HTML file, which serves as a front and hub for all the other work done.

## Usage

After deployment I plan to use my webpage to keep track of the things I've learned throughout the class, using it as both proof of concept and notepad.


## License

I used the MIT License when making a Github for this project, and I believe in is open source under those guidelines.



## Tests

A few functions are currently called in the console area of the webpage, if one is curious about such things.
